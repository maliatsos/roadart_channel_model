# roadart_channel_model
The ROADART Geometric Stochastic Framework

This repository contains an implementation of the Geomteric Stochastic Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Truck-to-Truck channel model that was extracted in the context of the Horizon 2020 ROADART project.

The ROADART project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 636565.
More info on the project in www.roadart.eu

The repository is dynamic and it will continue to update after the conclusion of the project.
Long term support is provided by University of Piraeus Research Center (UPRC). 

Users should investigate roadart_simulator.m and main.m in order to understand the rationale behind the ROADART channel model and as a tutorial on the use of the functional procedures and classes.

For information, questions, contributions and bugs please contanct UPRC - we will be happy to assist you or cooperate.
